# Process merchant review webhook

When accessing an order on the Signifyd dashboard, it is possible to add a flag to the order (good/bad) through the 'Order review flag' configuration.
This flag causes a review webhook to be triggered. By default, the Signifyd extension does not process this webhook generated by the merchant's manual review, but it is possible to enable it through a database configuration.


### Enabling merchant review webhook processing

To enable merchant review webhook processing, run this command on database:

```
INSERT INTO core_config_data (path, value) VALUES ('signifyd/advanced/process_merchant_review_webhook', 1);
```
### Delete merchant review webhook configuration

To revert merchant review webhook processing to extension's default, delete the setting from database:

```
DELETE FROM core_config_data WHERE path='signifyd/advanced/process_merchant_review_webhook';
```

### Check merchant review webhook configuration

To check the merchant review webhook config, run this command on your database:

```
SELECT * FROM core_config_data WHERE path = 'signifyd/advanced/process_merchant_review_webhook';
```

If no result it's returned, then extension will not process the merchant review webhook.
